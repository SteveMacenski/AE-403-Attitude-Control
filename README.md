# AE-403-Attitude-Control
Programs, Simulations, and Spacecraft Animations from AE 403, Attitude Control

Homeworks by Professor Koki Ho of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Code based loosely on templates from AE 352 from Professor Tim Bretl that I adapted. 

This class covered advanced concepts relevant to attitude control. Homework 1 covers basic review of kinematics using robotics notation. Homework 2 covers a variety of attitude representations including Euler angles, axis angle thrm, quaternions, Rodregeuz parameters, etc. Homework 3 covers dynamics and equations of motion. Homework 4 is advanced dynamics. Homework 5 is a review of Optimal Control by means of a Linear Quadratic Regulator.
